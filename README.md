#Pet Kingdom Website.

This project is a website for Pet Kingdoms, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made this website for my first-year assignment in web designing. It features a variety of pet food products and services, all easy to find with user-friendly navigation. The design focuses on both creativity and practicality, aiming to provide a great online experience for pet owners and lovers.

Below are some images of the mentioned webpage.
